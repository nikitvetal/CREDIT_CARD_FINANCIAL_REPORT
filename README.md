# CREDIT_CARD_FINANCIAL_REPORT
POWER BI DASHBOARD
Project Objective
    The main goal of this project is to develop a dynamic and insightful Power BI dashboard for a credit card company. By analyzing transaction and customer data, the dashboard will empower stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), understand customer behavior, and make informed, data-driven decisions to drive business growth and profitability.

Dataset
  This project will utilize a financial dataset, potentially based on anonymized credit card transaction data, typically sourced from platforms like Kaggle or provided by financial institutions for analysis. 
-
Potential data tables:
  customers: Contains demographic details (customer ID, age, gender, location, income level, education, marital status) and account status information.
  transactions: Records individual transaction details (transaction ID, date, amount, type, category, city).
  account_info: Holds account-specific details (credit limit, card type).

Steps
1) Data Extraction and Preparation:
  Source the data: Obtain the credit card financial dataset, likely in CSV or Excel format.
  Load into Power BI: Import the datasets into Power BI Desktop using Power Query.
  Transform and clean: Use Power Query Editor to clean and shape the data by:
  Fixing data types for consistency.
  Handling missing or inconsistent values.
  Creating new columns (e.g., year, month, day) from date fields to enable time-based analysis.
  Structuring the data into a star schema model to optimize for dashboard performance.

3) Data Modeling and Calculation:
  Build relationships: Establish relationships between the different tables (customers, transactions, account_info) based on common keys (e.g., customer_id).
  Create DAX measures: Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create key metrics for financial and customer analysis, including:
  Total Revenue
  Total Interest Earned
  Total Transactions
  Week-over-Week (WoW) Change
  Total Customers
  Activation Rate and Delinquency Rate

4) Dashboard Development:
  Design a layout: Create a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing dashboard layout with multiple pages, potentially separating transaction and customer insights.
  Create visualizations: Utilize a variety of Power BI visuals to represent the data effectively:
  KPI cards: For high-level financial metrics like revenue and total transactions.
  Line charts: To display trends over time for revenue, interest earned, and transaction volume.
  Bar/Column charts: To compare performance across different categories like spending types, income groups, or customer demographics.
  Pie/Donut charts: To show the distribution of transactions by category.
  Maps: To visualize transaction and customer data by geographic location.
  Add interactivity: Incorporate filters and slicers for different dimensions (e.g., date, gender, location, card type) to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

4) Deployment and Sharing:
  Publish to Power BI Service: Publish the completed dashboard to the Power BI Service to share it with stakeholders.
  Set up data refresh: Configure the dashboard for regular data refreshes to ensure insights are based on the most current data.


Insights and Actions
---
1. Insights from Transaction Analysis
  Identified trends: Recognize seasonal spending patterns, peak transaction times (e.g., holiday season), and popular transaction categories.
  Revenue streams: Understand which card types and customer segments are most profitable based on revenue and interest generated.
  Regional performance: Identify high-performing regions (e.g., Texas, New York, California) and compare their contributions to overall revenue.
  Financial health: Monitor delinquency and activation rates to assess the overall health and risk of the credit card portfolio. 
2. Actions from Transaction Analysis
  Targeted promotions: Launch marketing campaigns during peak spending seasons and offer incentives for popular transaction categories.
  Strategic focus: Prioritize expansion and resource allocation in high-revenue-generating regions.
  Risk mitigation: Implement proactive measures to support customers with high delinquency rates, such as offering payment plans or educational resources.
3. Insights from Customer Analysis
  Demographic spending patterns: Discover how spending habits differ across various demographic groups (e.g., age, income level, education), revealing that the 40-50 age group and those with a graduate degree are    significant customer segments.
  Customer satisfaction: Link customer satisfaction scores to spending behavior to understand the impact of experience on transaction volume and revenue.
  Segmentation: Segment customers based on spending and behavioral data to develop personalized marketing strategies and product offerings. 
4. Actions from Customer Analysis
  Tailored campaigns: Create customized marketing content and loyalty programs targeting specific demographic segments, like rewards for graduate degree holders or tailored card benefits for high-income customers.
